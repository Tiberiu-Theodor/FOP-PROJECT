    //Hello Tasin, I have realised something while creating my player class, Ground and Wall were just meant as placeholders, but I advise you to create
    //an enumeration and place them there(look what I did in orientation class), as making a list of walls and ground objects would be way too tedious
    //Instead, try to focus on creating a MATRIX using integers in this class. Thank you.
